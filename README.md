## Preview of Interview Scheduler

## Functionality

* Interviews can be booked between Monday and Friday.
* A user can switch between weekdays.
* A user can book an interview in an empty appointment slot.
* Interviews are booked by typing in a student name and clicking on an interviewer from a list of available interviewers.
* A user can cancel an existing interview.
* A user can edit the details of an existing interview.
* The list of days informs the user how many slots are available for each day.
* The expected day updates the number of spots available when an interview is booked or canceled.
* A user is presented with a confirmation when they attempt to cancel an interview.
* A user is shown an error if an interview cannot be saved or deleted.
* A user is shown a status indicator while asynchronous operations are in progress.
* When the user presses the close button of the error they are returned to the Form or Show view (skipping Status and Confirm).
* The application makes API requests to load and persist data. We do not lose data after a browser refresh.
